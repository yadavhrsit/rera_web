# RERA Website

Welcome to the README for the **RERA Website**. This website is built using React.js and Material-UI (MUI) to provide an informative showcase of the features of our Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) system. In addition to showcasing features, explaining our pricing structure, and offering user ratings, we've included a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section to address common inquiries. Below, you'll find an overview of the sections and information included on this website.
